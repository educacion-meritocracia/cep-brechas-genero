# Perceived and ideal salary gaps by gender

This repository contains the documentation of studies analyzing perceived and ideal salaries for different occupations according to gender.

## Studies

- Study 1: comparison of perceived and ideal salaries by gender for the occupations of a factory line worker and a general manager with CHilean ISSP data for 1999, 2009 & 2019. We explore whether men and women perceive and justify wages differently. Based on a rational approach, we expect that in a country with a high salary gap like Chile, women would perceive lower wages and justify larger salaries & gaps.

-Study 2: perceived and just salaries for occupations that specify the gender (Desiguales Survey, Chile 2017)
