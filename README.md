# Perceived and ideal salary gaps by gender

This repository contains the documentation of studies analyzing perceived and ideal salaries for different occupations according to gender.

A first study compares perceived and ideal salaries by gender for the occupations of a factory line worker and a general manager. We explore whether men and women perceive and justify wages differently. Based on a rational approach, we expect that in a country with a high salary gap like Chile, women would perceive lower wages and justify larger salaries.
